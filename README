[Intro]
I created this simple program after reading divx/mpeg4 related forums. It comes to me that there arent any software developed in GNU/Linux (nor other UN*X-variant) that have similiar functionality as "Nic's Mini AviC" in Microsoft Windows platform. 

* Note : Transcode package includes 'avifix' that can change fourcc, but it isnt compact enough and arent available by itself.

[Background]
FourCC (Four Character Code) is a (rather crude) method to identify codec used to encode Microsoft RIFF AVI files. Application software/hardware use the FourCC to correctly select a codec suitable for playing the AVI file in question. The problem arises when a video player (usually the hardware one) fail to recognize a FourCC, and unable to select a newer/compatible codec to play the AVI file. This simple program solves this problem by providing a simple way to change the FourCC of the AVI file to a value accepted by the video player. 

For an unofficial list of FourCC/codec out there in the wild, please refer to 'codelist.txt'.

[Installation]
1) Just type 'make all'. 
2) be a root user and type 'make install'
3) use the software as normal user. - refer usage section

[Alternatives]
Alternatively, you can use

avifix 
AVI file tools, part of the Transcode project.


[RPM package]
RPM package MAY BE made available at the project's page. Please email me if you absolutely in need of such package.


[Usage]
To obtain fourcc code for an avi file, type :
cfourcc file.avi		or,
